"""Phase 2 tests: the Attribution tab renderer + UI wiring.

- render:       build_attribution_html produces the scorecard + evidence panels
                for a real diagnosis, and a clean notice when degraded.
- construction: build_ui() constructs the whole Blocks (incl. the Attribution
                tab + its callback wiring) without error — catches component /
                callback mismatches.
