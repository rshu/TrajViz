"""The LLM surfaces must never send trajectory content without a user action.

TrajViz is offline-by-default analytics over traces that routinely contain
source code, absolute local paths, shell commands and customer data. Any
outbound LLM call therefore needs an explicit, declinable user action. These
tests read the real Gradio dependency graph of the built dashboard rather than
source text, so a future rewiring cannot slip past them.
