"""Invariants about the test suite itself.

The suite grew 199 -> 602 tests in the PR #13 fork sync and is now edited by
several people at once, mostly by appending to existing files. That makes three
specific failure modes likely, and all three are *invisible*: the suite stays
green while quietly testing less than it appears to.

  * **Shadowed tests.** Two ``def test_x`` in one class is legal Python — the
    second binding silently replaces the first, so the earlier test is deleted
    without a diff marker, a collection error, or a change in the pass count.
  * **Files that collect nothing.** A module whose tests were renamed out of the
    ``test_*`` convention (or a file added with only helpers) reports no failure
    at all; its subject stops being covered while the file still looks tested.
  * **Unconditionally disabled tests.** A bare ``@unittest.skip`` / ``skip`` /
    ``xfail`` marker turns a failing test into a green run forever. Conditional
    skips (``skipUnless``/``skipIf``, which guard optional fixtures and explicit
    legacy-schema compatibility checks) are legitimate and are deliberately allowed.

These are checked by parsing the test sources rather than importing them, so
the check itself has no import side effects or dependence on local datasets.
